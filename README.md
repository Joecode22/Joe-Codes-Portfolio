# CSS-Portfolio-Example

## Example portfolio page using HTML and CSS

This purpose of this project was to use different aspects of html, css, and advanced css in order to build an example portfolio project.

I was able to use some advance CSS properties like flexbox and grid to not only match the layout but to also behave responsively on different screen sizes

One particular property that I had never saw or used before this project was using the html selector in CSS to set up a smooth scrolling effect when internal navigation links are clicked. So this was a learning experience, for sure.
